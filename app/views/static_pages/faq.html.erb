  <p class="faq">Q: Do I have to pay to play?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, and in fact that would be illegal. That is how state run lotteries work. Our credits, and payouts, are generated by advertising dollars. We promise not to spam you with annoying popups and ads that detract from the user experience, but this is the reason ads are present throughout the games.</p>



  <p class="faq">Q: Do I get locked out (like Candy Crush or Trivia Crack)?</p>

  <p class="answer">No, that would be annoying. We want you to keep playing so you earn more credits and deposit them into the pot. The more you play and the more friends you invite the quicker the jackpot fills up. As soon as it is full we draw the winner. More people = more frequent payouts in larger amounts

  <p class="faq">Q: What do you win if one of your credits is chosen?</p>
  <p class="answer">Cold. Hard. Cash.</p>

  <p class="faq">Q: Seriously? I win real money in the amount of the jackpot?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes. Well we give you a check, but you get the point....no gimmicks</p>


  <p class="faq">Q: Is there just one jackpot?</p>
  <p class="answer">For now yes, but we will expand to have a "mega lottery" which will be the main jackpot, but also run simultaneous smaller jackpots like a daily jackpot, weekly jackpot, $500, $10,000, etc</p>

  <p class="faq">Q: What's the benefit of holding onto your credits and not immediately depositing them in the jackpot?</p>
  <p class="answer">Your credits belong to you so you can deposit them when you see fit. If you would like to save them for weeks or months then deposit them all at the same time to improve your chances of winning a certain jackpot when you have hundreds or thousands of credits then you are welcome to do so.</p>
